#' @details
#' The broadcast address is a special address at which any host connected
#' to the network can receive messages. That is, packets sent to this address
#' are received by all hosts on the network.
#' In IPv4, the last address of a network is the broadcast address.
#' Although IPv6 does not follow this approach to broadcast addresses, the
#' `broadcast_address()` function still returns the last address of the network.
