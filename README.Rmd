This package provides classes for working with IP addresses, inspired by the Python [`ipaddress`](https://docs.python.org/library/ipaddress.html) module.

Here are some of the features:

* Fully supports both **IPv4 and IPv6** address spaces
* **Efficiently stores** addresses in their native format (a sequence of bits)
* Calculations are performed in C++ for **improved performance**
* Classes are **compatible with the tidyverse**


## Installation

You can install the released version of ipaddress from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ipaddress")
```

Or you can install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("davidchall/ipaddress")
```


## Usage

This package provides the `ip_address()` and `ip_network()` classes, which can be used as standalone vectors or as columns within data frames and tibbles.

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ipaddress)

x <- tibble(
  address = ip_address(c("192.168.0.1", "2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334")),
  network = ip_network(c("192.168.100.0/22", "2001:db8::/48"))
)
x
```

Input character vectors are validated as they are parsed.
Invalid inputs raise a warning and are replaced with `NA`.

```{r input_validation}
ip_address(c("0.0.0.0", "255.255.255.255", "255.255.255.256"))
```

Functions are provided to enable common tasks:

```{r}
mutate(x, ipv6 = is_ipv6(address), in_net = is_within(address, network))
```
