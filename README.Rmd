This package provides classes for working with IP addresses, inspired by the Python [ipaddress](https://docs.python.org/library/ipaddress.html) module.

Here are some of the features:

* Fully supports both **IPv4 and IPv6** address spaces
* **Efficiently stores** addresses in their native format (a sequence of bits)
* Calculations are performed in C++ for **improved performance**
* Classes are **compatible with the tidyverse**
* Functions for **generation and analysis of IP data**


## Installation

You can install the released version of ipaddress from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ipaddress")
```

Or you can install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("davidchall/ipaddress")
```


## Usage

This package provides the `ip_address()` and `ip_network()` classes, which can be used as standalone vectors or as columns within data frames and tibbles.

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ipaddress)

x <- tibble(
  address = ip_address(c("192.168.0.1", "2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334")),
  network = ip_network(c("192.168.100.0/22", "2001:db8::/48"))
)

x
```

Input character vectors are validated as they are parsed.
Invalid inputs raise a warning and are replaced with `NA`.

```{r input_validation}
ip_address(c("255.255.255.255", "255.255.255.256"))
```

Functions are provided to enable common tasks:

```{r}
mutate(x, ipv6 = is_ipv6(address), in_net = is_within(address, network))
```


## Related work

* [**iptools**](https://hrbrmstr.github.io/iptools/) --  A well established R package for working with IP addresses and networks. Unfortunately IPv6 support is severely limited. Also, addresses and networks are stored as character vectors, so they must be parsed to their native bit representation for every operation. It served as an excellent guide and motivation for the ipaddress package.
* [**cyberpandas**](https://cyberpandas.readthedocs.io) -- A Python package for using IP addresses in a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) DataFrame. This offers full support for IPv6 and stores addresses in the native bit representation. However, most "interesting" operations must deserialize each address to a Python [ipaddress](https://docs.python.org/library/ipaddress.html) object, which is slow. It also doesn't support IP networks.
