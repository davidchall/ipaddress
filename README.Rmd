ipaddress provides data classes and functions for working with IP addresses and networks. Its interface is inspired by the Python [ipaddress](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html) module.

Here are some of the features:

* Functions for **generation and analysis of IP data**
* Full support for both **IPv4 and IPv6** address spaces
* **Memory footprint:** data stored in native format
* **Performance:** calculations performed in C++
* Compatible with the **tidyverse**

For data visualization of IP addresses and networks, check out the [ggip](https://davidchall.github.io/ggip/) package.


## Installation

You can install the released version of ipaddress from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ipaddress")
```

Or you can install the development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("davidchall/ipaddress")
```


## Usage

Use `ip_address()` and `ip_network()` vectors either standalone or as columns in a data frame.

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ipaddress)

tibble(
  address = ip_address(c("192.168.0.1", "2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334")),
  network = ip_network(c("192.168.100.0/22", "2001:db8::/80"))
)
```

Input character vectors are validated as they are parsed.
Invalid inputs raise a warning and are replaced with `NA`.

```{r input_validation}
ip_address(c("255.255.255.255", "255.255.255.256"))
```

A variety of functions are provided to enable common tasks.

```{r}
tibble(network = ip_network(c("192.168.100.0/22", "2001:db8::/80"))) %>%
  mutate(
    first = network_address(network),
    last = broadcast_address(network),
    ipv6 = is_ipv6(network)
  )
```


## Related work

* [**iptools**](https://hrbrmstr.github.io/iptools/) --  A well established R package for working with IP addresses and networks. Unfortunately IPv6 support is severely limited. Also, addresses and networks are stored as character vectors, so they must be parsed to their native bit representation for every operation. It served as an excellent guide and motivation for ipaddress.
* [**cyberpandas**](https://cyberpandas.readthedocs.io) -- A Python package for using IP addresses in a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) DataFrame. This offers full support for IPv6 and stores addresses in the native bit representation. However, most "interesting" operations must deserialize each address to a Python [ipaddress](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html) object, which is slow. It also doesn't support IP networks.
