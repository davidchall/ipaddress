## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Put acronyms within single quotes in the title and description of the DESCRIPTION.
* Added \value to all .Rd files that are not data files and explain the functions results in the documentation.
* Fixed a typo in the \examples section of network_mask.Rd.


## Test environments
* macOS 10.15 (local), R 3.6.2
* macOS 10.15 (GitHub Actions), R 3.6.2
* macOS 10.15 (GitHub Actions), R-devel
* Ubuntu 16.04 (GitHub Actions), R 3.2.5, 3.3.3, 3.4.4, 3.5.3, 3.6.2

* New submission

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
     IP (2:13, 10:39)
     IPv (12:22, 12:31)

The acronyms IP, IPv4 and IPv6 are spelled correctly.

* checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... NOTE
Found the following files/directories:
  'ipaddress-Ex_x64.Rout' 'tests_i386' 'tests_x64'
  'examples_i386' 'examples_x64' 'ipaddress-Ex_i386.Rout'
  
These seem to be specific to the RHub build environment.


## Reverse dependencies
This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
